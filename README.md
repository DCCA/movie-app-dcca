# Movie App

This app was made using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Node.js, Express and SASS.
For the movies information I used the OMDB free api.
I have also used Gulp for compilation of the SCSS and JS.

## Try Yourself

You can run this app using the folowing instructions:
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a file in the root directory called config.js
3. Create an account in the OMDB (https://www.omdbapi.com/)
4. In the config.js, create a const named MY_KEY
5. Insert your API Key in that variable
6. Make sure this const created is accessible in other js files
7. Run the app :D
